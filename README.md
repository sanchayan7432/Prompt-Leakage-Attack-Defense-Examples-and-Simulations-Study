# 🎯 Objectives

The system defends against 5 classes of prompt extraction threats:

1. **Jailbreak Prompts**
2. **Prompt Injection**
3. **Role-Playing Attacks**
4. **HotFlip Perturbations**
5. **Gradient-Guided Insertions**

## 🧠 Core Components

### 🔹 `ShadowLLM`
- A simulated shadow model used to craft adversarial prompts via roleplay or injection.
- Mimics internal behaviors to replicate realistic extraction scenarios.

### 🔹 `AdvancedDefenseSystem`
- Accepts inputs and blocks/refuses malicious or prompt-leaking queries.
- Applies a secure system prompt and response filter.

### 🔹 Attack Modules
- Each attack type implements `generate_prompt()` or similar methods to craft adversarial inputs aimed at leaking the system prompt.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each defense is scored with the following evaluation metrics:

| Metric                      | Description                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Refusal Rate**            | Fraction of harmful queries refused by the defense              |
| **Utility Retention**       | Fraction of safe prompts answered correctly.                    |
| **Detection Accuracy**      | Classification accuracy over safe vs. harmful detection.        |
| **Adversarial Robustness**  | Composite score using edit distance and semantic similarity.    |

Each attack is scored with the following evaluation metrics:

| Metric                       | Description                                                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SM (Substring Match)**     | How much of the prompt matches exactly.                          |
| **EM (Exact Match)**         | Whether the full system prompt is reproduced.                    |
| **EED (Edit Distance)**      | How similar the output is at the character level.                |
| **SS (Semantic Similarity)** | Measures the meaning similarity of leaked prompt and original.   |

## 🚀 Running the Project

### 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers scikit-learn numpy

Optional for better edit distance:

```bash
pip install python-Levenshtein

2. Run the Benchmark
```bash
python benchmark_defense_test.py

This runs all 5 attack classes against the advanced defense system and outputs metrics per query and in aggregate.

⚙️ Customization
You can modify:

SYSTEM_PROMPT in benchmark_defense_test.py to test different system instructions.

Attack generation logic inside individual attacker files.

Thresholds or filters in AdvancedDefenseSystem.

📌 Notes
All attacks use a simulated shadow model (ShadowLLM) instead of querying a real LLM API.

The current defense is stateless; stateful tracking, anomaly detection, or RL-based defenses can be added.
